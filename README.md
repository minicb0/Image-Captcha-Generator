# Spider On-Sites CWD Tasks
This repo is to hold the onsites task of Spider Inductions.

## BACKEND - EASY
- [x] Create an image captcha generator.

## Idea
- [x] The image captcha is generated using canvas.
- [x] The UI of this app is based on a login page. If you type the correct captcha as shown in picture, it will redirect you to the dashboard and will tell you that you have entered correct captcha. If the input of your captcha is incorrect, it tells you that you have entered the wrong captcha and so it redirects you to the same login page for the user to fill the input again.
